Take a subset of the dataset to make it less sparse/ denser. ( For example, keep the users only who has given 50 or more number of ratings )
Split the data randomly into train and test dataset. ( For example, split it in 70/30 ratio)
Build Popularity Recommender model.
Build Collaborative Filtering model.
Evaluate both the models. ( Once the model is trained on the training data, it can be used to compute the error (RMSE) on predictions made on the test data.)
Get top - K ( K = 5) recommendations. Since our goal is to recommend new products for each user based on his/her habits, we will recommend 5 new products.
